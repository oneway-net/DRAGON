The DRAGON GMPLS software suite is free software that combines an
open-source routing package with an open-source signaling package and
extends both to support GMPLS routing and signaling.

For GMPLS routing, we have extended the open-source Zebra software
(http://www.zebra.org).  For GMPLS signaling, we have extending the
KOM-RSVP implementation from Darmstadt University of Technology.  This
includes extending these software components to include the MPLS/GMPLS
RFCs and drafts such as RFC3630, RFC3477, RFC3471, RFC3473,
draft-ietf-ccamp-ospf-gmpls-extensions-12.txt and others.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

See the docs directory for configuration and detailed usage
information.
