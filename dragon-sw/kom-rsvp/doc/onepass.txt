TERMINOLOGY
weak = created through onepass resp. duplex request

SEMANTICS
- mandate FF for onepass, mandate unicast for duplex
- PATHRESV creates PSB and RSB, RSB is flagged as 'weak' through nhop=0,0
- RESV adds distinct RSB (different next hop)
- weak and regular RSB coexist
- several PATH messages from distinct senders might create the "same" RSB
  -> that's why only FF can be supported

- DUPLEX creates reverse weak PSB, flagged through phop=0,0 and RSB as above
  . reverse PSB bound to original (not forwarded through TTL=0)
  . ignore DUPLEX PSB, if PSB already exists
- PATH, PTEAR, timeout, no DUPLEX removes reverse PSB (and consequently RSB)
- reverse regular PSB finds weak PSB and changes relationship to PHopSB
  . routing must be symmetrical, if not -> bad luck

forwarding of reservations
- merge 'weak' indication of RSB into OutISB by AND -> onepassAll
  . explicitly triggered new updateTC
- merge OutISBs' indication into PSB and then PHopSB by AND
  . during calculateForwardFlowspec
- forward reservation, only if PSB/PHopSB is not 'onepassAll'
- remove reservation, only if PSB is not 'onepass'
  . TODO: this has to be improved (deciding on onepassAll triggers RTEAR on
    failed PATHRESV)
